# Understanding Purchase Orders

## What is a Purchase Order (PO)?

A **Purchase Order** is a document you send to a supplier to order items you need. Think of it like a shopping list, but official.

### Real-World Example:

**Scenario:** You need 10 coffins and 5 tents for upcoming funerals.

1. **You create a PO** listing:
   - 10 x Coffin (Pine)
   - 5 x Tent (Large)
   - Prices you agreed with supplier
   - Expected delivery date

2. **You send it to the supplier** (via email)

3. **Supplier receives it** and knows:
   - What you want
   - How many
   - What price you're paying
   - When you need it

4. **Supplier delivers** the items

5. **You receive** and update your inventory

## Why Use Purchase Orders?

✅ **Official record** - Proof of what you ordered  
✅ **Clear communication** - Supplier knows exactly what you need  
✅ **Price protection** - Agreed prices are documented  
✅ **Inventory planning** - You know what's coming  
✅ **Financial tracking** - Know what you're spending  

## How It Works in Your System

### Step 1: Create PO
- Select supplier (who you're buying from)
- Enter PO number (like "PO-2025-001")
- Set dates

### Step 2: Add Items
- **Select item** from your inventory list (dropdown)
- **See suggested price** (from your inventory records)
- **Adjust price** if needed (supplier might quote different price)
- **Enter quantity** you want to order

### Step 3: Send to Supplier
- Click "Send to Supplier"
- Professional email sent automatically
- Supplier gets all details
- You get a copy for your records

### Step 4: Receive Items
- When supplier delivers, mark items as received
- Inventory automatically updates
- Stock levels increase

## About Prices

**Why prices might differ:**
- Your inventory has a "unit_price" (what you sell it for)
- Supplier might charge different price (their cost to you)
- You can adjust the price when creating PO

**Example:**
- You sell coffin for R 5,000 (unit_price in inventory)
- Supplier sells it to you for R 3,500 (PO price)
- You enter R 3,500 in the PO (what you're paying supplier)

## The Process Flow

```
1. Create PO → 2. Add Items → 3. Send Email → 4. Supplier Delivers → 5. Receive Items → 6. Inventory Updates
```
